# You will need...

* 1/2 cup [rolled oats](https://oatseveryday.com/know-your-oats-2/#rolled-oats) (125 ml)
* 1 cup milk dairy or non-dairy (250 ml)
* 1 Tbsp honey or agave (15 ml)
* 1/4 cup yogurt vanilla (60 ml)
* 1 cup berries strawberry, raspberry, blueberry or blackberry, frozen (250 ml)

## Servings: 1

## Time: 8mins

## Ready, Set, OAT!

Start by peeling the bananas and the apple, then slice them up and add them to the blender. If you want more nutrients, leave the skin on the apple, but it may result in a smoothie that is not fully smooth if your blender is not very powerful.

Then, to the blender add washed baby spinach and the juice of 1 lemon. Add about 1 cup’s worth of water, or as needed, depending on how thick or thin you like your smoothie – start with less water, and add it as it blends, until the smoothie is of the consistency you like.

Close down your blender and blend away!

I don’t have a Vitamix, so I just blend it on full power until I no longer see chunks of spinach or apples in the smoothie.

Serving suggestions

Serve this spinach green smoothie as soon as it’s done, as water-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin C, will deteriorate with time. I usually like to transfer it to 2 tall glasses for serving.

Storage tips

If you want to serve this smoothie later, store it in 2 jars and close them with a lid. Make sure there is little room left in the jar for air, as air will cause oxidation in the fruit, making the smoothie turn a brownish hue with time. This is purely cosmetics, though and the smoothie will still be ok to drink.
