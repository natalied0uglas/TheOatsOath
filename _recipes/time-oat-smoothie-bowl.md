# Let's Begin!

You will need...

* 1/2 cup [rolled oats](https://oatseveryday.com/know-your-oats-2/#rolled-oats) (125 ml)
* 1 cup milk dairy or non-dairy (250 ml)
* 1 Tbsp honey or agave (15 ml)
* 1/4 cup yogurt vanilla (60 ml)
* 1 cup berries strawberry, raspberry, blueberry or blackberry, frozen (250 ml)

## Servings: 1

## Time: 8mins

## Ready, Set, OAT!

The night before, add all the ingredients except for the frozen banana to the bowl of your [blender](http://amzn.to/2HmYtyW) and give it a stir to ensure that everything is well combined. Cover and place in the fridge for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight. This step isn’t absolutely necessary, but allowing the oats and seeds to soak for a few hours will make them easier to blend and give you a smoother, creamier smoothie.

When ready to eat, add the frozen banana and blend on high until oats are fully broken down and a smooth and creamy consistency is reached, adding more milk if the smoothie is too thick. Transfer it to a bowl, garnish with toppings of choice, and enjoy!
