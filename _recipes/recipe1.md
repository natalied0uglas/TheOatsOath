# Let's Begin!

You will need...

* 1/2 cup [rolled oats](https://oatseveryday.com/know-your-oats-2/#rolled-oats) (125 ml)
* 1 cup milk dairy or non-dairy (250 ml)
* 1 Tbsp honey or agave (15 ml)
* 1/4 cup yogurt vanilla (60 ml)
* 1 cup berries strawberry, raspberry, blueberry or blackberry, frozen (250 ml)

## Servings: 1

## Time: 8mins

## Ready, Set, OAT!

Whisk together the oats with 1/4 cup water, then microwave for 1 minute, cool, then add to blender.

Place the rest of the ingredients into the blender and puree until creamy and thick. Divide into two glasses and serve! 

Notes

* Microwaving the oats first will help provide a smoother texture. Alternatively, you can combine the oats and water together and place in the fridge overnight before adding to the smoothie. OR, you can just add the oats raw, it will just be slightly more chewy! Not bad though- I do this all the time!
