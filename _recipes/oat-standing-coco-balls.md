# Let's Begin!

You will need...

* 1/2 cup [rolled oats](https://oatseveryday.com/know-your-oats-2/#rolled-oats) (125 ml)
* 1 cup milk dairy or non-dairy (250 ml)
* 1 Tbsp honey or agave (15 ml)
* 1/4 cup yogurt vanilla (60 ml)
* 1 cup berries strawberry, raspberry, blueberry or blackberry, frozen (250 ml)

## Servings: 1

## Time: 8mins

## Ready, Set, OAT!

STEP 1: BLEND THE CASHEWS

Place cashews in the bowl of a food processor; blend until they break down to the consistency of a coarse sand.

STEP 2: BLEND OATS, COCONUT FLAKES, AND HEMP SEEDS:

Next, add oats, coconut flakes, and hemp seeds to food processor; process again until finely ground.

STEP 3: ADD CASHEW BUTTER, MAPLE SYRUP, AND VANILLA

Add wet ingredients to food processor: cashew butter, maple syrup (or honey), and vanilla. Blend until ingredients come together and form a dough-like ball. Do NOT over-mix or you run the risk of too many oils releasing from the nuts and the mixture becoming greasy.

STEP 4: MIX IN WHITE CHOCOLATE AND FREEZE-DRIED RASPBERRIES

Turn mixture out into a large mixing bowl. Add chopped white chocolate and raspberries, and use your hands to mix all ingredients together. (The freeze-dried raspberries will crumble into small pieces in the process, which is what you want.)

STEP 5: FORM MIXTURE INTO BALLS

Use a small cookie scoop (or spoon) to scoop the mixture into 26 to 28 balls. If using a spoon, roll them into balls. If using a cookie scoop, I just like to keep them in the mold of the scoop. Transfer the balls to the refrigerator to chill.
